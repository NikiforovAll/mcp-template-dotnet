# MCPServerHybrid

## Overview
This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation built with .NET 9.0. The MCP server provides a communication protocol for facilitating interactions between various components in a model-driven system. This implementation demonstrates how to set up a basic MCP server with custom tools and services.
